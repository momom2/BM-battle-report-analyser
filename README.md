# BM-battle-report-analyser
This Python script can be used to extract meaningful data which would otherwise be hard or tedious to get from battle reports. 
It requires the user's e-mail address and BM password to function.

treat_battle_report_SHARABLE is the file you want to run to use the script.

Non-exhaustive list of ways the script may malfunction :
-if a character's name matches some keywords (will list these keywords maybe)
-if a unit's name matches some keywords (idem)
-if a character who participated in the battle you want to analyse died since then
-if several units/characters have the same name
-if a unit present does not participate in the battle
-if rogues/militia/monsters are involved

Some functions are broken/still under development, although I don't remember which ones. If you spot one, please warn me.

If you find a bug, please warn me, and I'll try to fix it.
If you have an idea for a feature that would be neat, please inform me and I'll see if I can add it !

My Discord tag is momom2#7864 and my family's name is Pemrose.

This script was inspired by the player of the Gabanus family, who has written a program to transfer battle reports from html to the wiki and because as marshal I was tired of going throught the same calculations every week.
You can find his program here : https://brave-rock-01fd9e403.azurestaticapps.net/

I hope you have as much fun playing around with this script as I did. \(^-^)/


This script is still under development, although not nearly as much as it was a month ago.
